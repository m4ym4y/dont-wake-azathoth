Reality is nothing more than the dream of an alien god, and when that god awakens everything we know will cease.

In this game, you must play the music that keeps Azathoth slumbering, preventing the end of the world. Eventually he will awaken, but you must delay that as long as possible for the sake of our world!

Controls:

- H, J, K, L will play notes
- Space will kill monsters and grab powerups!
